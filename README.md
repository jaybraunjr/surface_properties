# surface_properties
This is used for calculating the surface properties of membrane (bilayer of lipid droplet systems). This includes tail order parameters (Scd), surface triacylglycerol lifetimes, and interdigitation analysis.

The density overlap function is defined as:

$$
\rho_{ov}(z) = 4 \frac{\rho_{TG}(z) \rho_{PL}(z)}{(\rho_{TG}(z) + \rho_{PL}(z))^2}
$$
